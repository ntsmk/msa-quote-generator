## Why I Built This

In my MSP work, I noticed that coworkers were manually calculating quotes based on asset counts provided by customers.  
It’s not efficient and doesn’t offer a good UI/UX experience.

I wanted a simple, user-friendly tool that:
- Calculates pricing instantly  
- Reduces errors from manual work  
- Looks clean and professional  
- Can be accessed easily by the team

So I built this browser-based MSA Quote Generator.

## Tech Stack

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript

This project doesn’t require complex AI/ML processing or a large backend system, so a simple frontend app is perfect for now.

## Deployment

Deployed on **Vercel**, chosen for its simplicity, fast deployment, and zero backend requirements for the current version.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Convert to React**  
   More sophisticated UI/UX.

2. **Login / Authentication**  
   Restrict tool access to internal staff and maintain user account–based data.

3. **Supabase Backend**  
   Store generated quotes, customers, pricing history, and asset configurations.
